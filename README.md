# TODO

## The template “Generate a detailed football training session on these parameters” should be split into 3 options.

- Generate a detailed football training exercise…
- Generate a detailed football training session…
- Generate a detailed football training cyclus (micro, macro, semester, half season, whole season
  and so on)

## The parameters have to be a lot more detailed. Included should be the following options.

- Groupage
- Teamsize
- Perfomance class (4 different options)
- Available coaches
- Duration
- player profiles?
- Aim of the training

The approach would be, giving the coach some kind of interface where he puts in those parameters and
which kind of prompt (one exercise, whole session or whole cyclus). He has to put in every
information into the interface and after that a training is created.

Interface:

- Select which kind of training you want to create: exercise, session or cyclus.
- Which age group do you train?
- How many players are available?
- Which performance class is your team? (Beginner,Advanced, high, pro)
- How long is the training? (For exercise: 0-120 min, session: 45-180 min, cyclus: 1 week-12 months)
- Put in the individual player profiles (Maybe a premium function, so that the session is adapted to
  the individual profile)
- Aim of the training (Differentiates between tactic, technic and individual goals)
