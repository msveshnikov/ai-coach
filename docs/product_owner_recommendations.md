### Additional Notes

Consider starting with a closed beta to gather early feedback and identify potential issues before
full launch. Also, recommend implementing analytics from day one to track feature usage and user
behavior patterns.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide more specific technical
recommendations?
