- Authentication system must be completed before exercise library user access
- Mobile responsive framework needed before any UI components

### Risks

1. **Technical Risks**
    - Video upload service costs might exceed initial estimates
    - Performance issues with video playback on mobile devices
2. **External Dependencies**
    - Cloud service provider availability
    - Third-party authentication service reliability
