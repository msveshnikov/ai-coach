# AI Coach - Technical Documentation

## Project Overview

AI Coach is a comprehensive platform designed for sports coaches and clubs to create and manage
training exercises using AI-powered recommendations. The platform offers personalized training
configurations, goal management, and club-wide methodology implementation.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React with Vite
- **UI Library**: Chakra UI
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **Routing**: React Router v7
- **API Integration**: React Query
- **Form Handling**: Formik with Yup validation

### Backend

- **Runtime**: Bun.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT + Google OAuth
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO
- **Container**: Docker

### Key Technologies

```json
{
    "Frontend": ["React", "Chakra UI", "Redux", "React Query"],
    "Backend": ["Bun.js", "MongoDB", "Socket.IO"],
    "Infrastructure": ["Docker", "Docker Compose"],
    "APIs": ["OpenAI", "Google OAuth", "Unsplash", "ElevenLabs"]
}
```

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

3. Configure environment variables:

```env
OPENAI_KEY=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
UNSPLASH_API_KEY=
ELEVEN_KEY=
JWT_SECRET=
EMAIL=
FROM_EMAIL=
EMAIL_PASSWORD=
FRONTEND_URL=
```

4. Start development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

5. For production deployment:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
